# Python Tricks



## Description

***"life is short, you need python"***

**Python Tricks** here you can understand them as something like advanced techniques, patterns or philosophy of Python. (<strike>Some are indeed tricks, by the way</strike>â˜º)



Currently, it mainly contains three parts: **basics**, **iterables** and **black magics**.

The most valuable part is `Inspiration`.  Even though you already knew this trick, but you rarely use it, because you don't know where to use, and `Inspiration` part will enlighten you.



Many example codes come from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/), I have tried my best to make a brief problem description, useful enough for most case, actually you can only focus on the trick. If you are also interested in problem, and want to go deep, you can visit [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/) for more information.



## Why should use tricks?

To make code concise, elegant and high-quality. (also efficient enough)

In my opinion, it obeys Python's philosophy: trading maybe a little bit performance for readability, usability, coding efficiency, and reducing possibility of bugs.

Or you simply want to play and have fun with Python.



## Attention

Like I said here: https://stackoverflow.com/q/55684960/11263560

> Discussion about whether should use python tricks like `~`:
>
> In my opinion, If it is a code maintained by yourself, you can use any trick to avoid potential bug or achieve goal easier, because of maybe a high readability and usability. But in team work, **avoid using 'too clever' code**, may bring troubles to your co-workers.

In Python Tricks, not all tricks are tricky, and not all tricks are suitable in your scenario. So It is you to decide which tricks should use, and which are not.

Actually I have added extra comments about the defect of tricks, to help you decide.




## Who is this for?
1. If you have mastered basic python skills or transferring from another language, and you want to enhance your python skills, to write a more pythonic-style code, here you can learn how to and where to use these advanced python tricks. 

2. If you want to write more cool or hackish python code, or just have a fun with python, here you will be enlightened and enjoy it.



## Who isn't this for?

This is not for Python beginners. I try to make it short and refined, just pick the most valuable tricks.

So it not includes all the advanced Python features, and I will not give a complete tutorial, either.  Maybe you need to refer to other materials to help you understand.



## Version

Python 3.6 or Above



## Future work

Currently, it mainly contains three parts: **basics**, **iterables** and **black magics**. I will continuously update once I dig a gold.

Maybe I will add the advanced usages and black magic of standard library, such as cool operator overloading, and also pick cool ideas from extra python tools. 

Maybe I will add more design patterns and philosophy of Python.



## Thanks to
* Special thanks to [Stefan Pochmann](https://leetcode.com/stefanpochmann/), many enlightening codes come from Stefan, and I really learned a lot from him.
* Thanks to all good problems from LeetCode. In addition, LeetCode has a great OJ platform, and really suitable to do functional and performance test.
* Many templates and tricks are enlightened by discussions in LeetCode, thanks to all the code masters.
